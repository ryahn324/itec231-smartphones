*This [project](https://ryahn324.github.io/itec231-smartphones/index.html) was done for ITEC 231 at Towson U.  
The site could be about anything students wanted as long as there was references (that were not my own idea) and displayed the taught fundamentals of HTML/CSS.*  

>What I did:
><ul>
>  <li>Designed a user-responsive website with print-friendly HTML/CSS, CSS Flexbox layout, and JavaScript.</li>
>  <li>Researched and compiled information on the topic of smartphones and its impact on education, business, lifestyles, and communication in society.</li>
></ul>
